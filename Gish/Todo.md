###

###
* implement `break` and `continue` (Node exists)
* fix division (and maybe others) `int` / `double` mismatch
+ 'inline' functions
	* as sentences
	- words (instead of 'identifier')
		-> ```this->currentToken.matches("AHAH");```
* save config
###
* imports
* binary
	=> stdlib
		=> print, scan
	=> default import (like vcruntime.h)
		=> squared, cubed
		=> other existing stuff
###
* positions in nodes and interpreted values;
* update Error messages
* code refactoring?
